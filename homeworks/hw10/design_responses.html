							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p>
								I really thought that this article was extremely interesting.  I have always been super interested by tbe intersection of psychology and the brain and computer science
								and I think that a large part of where that overlap happens is in UX design.  It is super important to think about how the brain works and processes thing in order to
								best understand how to outline and plan a website.  There are a lot of different things that we do not necessarily think about because we always take them for granted
								even though they should definitely be something we need to be aware of when we're planning something out for global use.
