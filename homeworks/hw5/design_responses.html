                                I learned a bit about how important animations can be to the overall message and coherance of a website.
                                With certain animations, we can direct the eyes to look in certain directions that help implicitly navegate
                                the website.  We can also use animations just because they look fancy, but doing that too often can make a
                                space look cluttered.

                            <p>
                                My favorie part of the article is was the etherium wallet.  It did a really good at sticking to a minimalist
                                design while adding particles and other effects.  It also kept a reallly really nice color pallete throughout
                                the entire design which ended up looking really nice.  I really enjoyed the glowing step progress bar.

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>
                                From an inspiration standpoint, I guess I like the midnight hour website with the woman on it because it looked
                                really clean as far as navigation goes as well as it had a lot of really cool looking animations.  It also did
                                what I was talking about before with having all of the elements direct your attention to where the intuitive next
                                place to go would be which realy helped solidify coherance.  The model's face as well as the color palette of the
                                entire website lend very well to the over aesthetic and appearance of the website and mood.
