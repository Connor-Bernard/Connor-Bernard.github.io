							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
                                I learned how important it is to use color for accessability because it really draws attention to the eye when used properly.
                                That being said, if color is improperly used in such a way that the contrast between an element and it's background, then it
                                may lead to issues with visibility.  For that reason, it is very important to pick color palettes that will not have high
                                contrast ratios.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
                                My favorite part of this article was the section where it talked about not solely relying on color for accessability.
                                It definitely is super important to use other icons to let users know if something has happened because a good amount
                                of the population has color blindness (especially red-green) such that it may be hard to see whether something is correct
                                and in green or incorrect in red.  I definitely intend on using this in the future when making design decisions.
