        <h1>Connor Bernard</h1>
        <p><strong><em>Computer Science Junior</em></strong>
        <p>Yo!  My name is (believe it or not) Connor.  I'm a junior here at Berkeley studying computer science!  I was lucky enough to declare last semester and got to scurry around my house looking for wifi to sign up for my classes for this semester.  Anyway, classes aside, I'm currently a contractor and software engineering team lead at Emotewell Inc. a startup focusing on mental wellness through online jounaling (you should totally check us out... shameless plug).  Outside of software dev and CS, I'm pretty interested in neuroscience and toxicology.  I actually was able to enroll in Drugs and the Brain this semester which is an iconic class that is notoriously hard to enroll in and I'm so happy I was able to get it because it really touches on many of my academic interests outside of CS.  Okay... academics aside, I am a contract photographer and have been doing contract photography for the past four or so years.  My main subjects are cars because I'm also a total car buff - hot take the LFA's V10 is wayyyy overrated.  Aside from my passion for cars, I also am sorta obsessed with knives mostly for the machinery aspect of them; I find them super satisfying to flick open and close and they come in handy way more often than people I've met generally expect so ask me what my cary for the day is if you share my passion!  On campus, I am part of a few tech clubs such as IEEE and CSUA, professional clubs including the Sigma Alpha Pi Professional fraternity, and social organizations including Sigma Nu social fraternity of which I am an executive officer.  Something super cool about me is that a shark bit my hand off... well not really but I do have one hand!  Feel free to ask me what happened if you're curious.  I'm also gay and try to do what I can to support the LGBTQIA+ community especially because often times I do not initially come across as gay.  Anyways, enough about me!  Lets get to the rest of the project :D</p>

            <li>My apartment (I live on west side right across from the teny tiny target)</li>

        <h3>Part 2</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Something that I learned from this article was that you reall have to take into account every little detail because if you do not, you may indirectly publish something that is super confusing to work with.  Even small things such as what does the placeholder text say can make a huge difference!</li>
            <li>My favorite part of the article was when they broke down twitter and spotify and called out things that I totally would not have taken note of, but if they were oriented in some other way, I would have found incredibly off.</li>
            <li><em>"By routinely analyzing other apps, youâ€™ll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself."</em></li>
