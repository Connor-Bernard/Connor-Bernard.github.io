					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned a lot about the timing of animations and how we shold plan the timing of animations when planning a site.  I definitely thought that it was really 
								important to make animation timings long enough to where people could appreciate the animations, but it turns out that is most commonly not the case;
								people like to enjoy the animation subconsciously, so if they are consciously thinking about it because of the time, it means they are waiting.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part of the article was the sections that covered how we should handle the animation speeds (specifically the graphics and gifs) because
							this element of design is definitely something that I have messed up in the past.  I really liked the illustrations because, if I was told that I should
							make my animations fast enough to prevent users from noticing, I would naturally agree, but I didn't realize what that threshold was.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>"Numerous researches have discovered that optimal speed for interface animation is between 200 and 500 ms."</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
