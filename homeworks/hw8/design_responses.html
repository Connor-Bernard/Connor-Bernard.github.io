						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>
                            I learned a lot about all of the different ways websites can be designed for dishonesty and baiting the
                            customer into doing things that they may not initially consent to or that they dont fully understand.
                            Particularly, I hadn't heard about the friend spam approach, but thiking about it, I definitely have fallen
                            for it before.  It is something that I will pay much more attention to.
                        </p>

						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>
                            My favorite part of the article was the section on forced continuity because I feel like it is one of the most
                            common dishonest practices that I genuinely see all of the time.  The model itself is so dishonest but people
                            are just used to it enough to where people do not bat an eye.  I would love to see more awareness on this topic.
