							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>

                                I learned from this article how important picking a font that fits a design is.  I never really gave it much thought beforehand
                                because I thought it was something that could be done at the end of the design process after all of the graphics were done, but
                                considering you need to factor in your audience as well, I think that it is something work considering earlier on in the design
                                stage.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
                                I was actually blown away by the examples that they provided because I thought about what they may look like if I swapped the fonts
                                on them.  It would simply look tacky and unsettling.  Moreover, given the rest of the design for either page, the font seemed natural
                                as though that were implicitly how it should be and any other font would simply be outlandish.  With this intuition in mind, I realize
                                how important it really is to be considerate of fonts when designing a website.
