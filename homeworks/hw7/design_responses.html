                                I learned about how important it is to organize the elements of a website in terms of relativity.  The principle of proximity with relation
                                to how people understand connection to elements was super important and helpful to learn about.  On the same note, the idea of managing Proximity
                                is also a question of managing white space.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
                                I think my favorite part of the article was the first section on how people generally initially view things.  I think the cognitive
                                basis of psychological categorization is super important and should definitely be factored into proper design and I really want to
                                learn more about how to best approach that.
